# About the game
Speed ​​Rider is an engaging, highly competitive racing game.<br>
Cruise through retro-style tracks in a lightning-fast go-kart, challenging the best players!<br>
The tracks bring with them many challenges! Every braking, acceleration, and steering maneuver must be executed with precision and at the right time to catch that fraction of a second that can lead you to the top of the scoreboards!<br>

Competitors will play on equal terms; you can't choose your vehicle; what makes the difference here is your skill!

Remember! Brake too much and you'll lose precious fractions of a second; brake too little and you'll find yourself flying off the track.

# Navigation
The top menu allows you to easily navigate the site.

From the `Home` page, you can directly access the two most popular courses, or challenge the ghosts of players who have just raced.

By clicking on `Courses`, you can see all available courses and the current record for that course.<br>
By clicking on a *`course`*, you'll see the map, a description of the course, and a ranking of all the challengeable ghosts.

`Login` allow you to access the site, or create an account if you're not already registered. Simply fill in the fields.

# How to play
## Starting a Game
A game can be started in several ways:

+ From the `Home` page, by tapping on one of the `latest games`, you will challenge the selected player.
+ By navigating to a track page and tapping on one of the `top players`, you will challenge the selected player.
+ By navigating to a track page and tapping on `Play` under `Time Trial` in the bottom right, you will be playing alone.

## Game Controls
Once you've chosen your course, you must complete **3 laps** of the track.
Pausing is not an option! A game can be interrupted but not paused, so make sure you are not disturbed during the race.

The game can be interrupted using the `Enter` key (**WARNING!** The game will be interrupted immediately after pressing the Enter key!).<br>
If you've pressed `Full Screen` and want to return to windowed view, simply press the `Esc` key on your keyboard.

## Vehicle Control
The go-kart can be controlled using the `arrow keys` and `Ctrl` or the "`WASD`" key combination plus the `Space` key.<br>
If you hold down the accelerator button during the countdown before **"1"** appears, you'll get a slight advantage.

 Here's the complete list of controls:

> ### Arrow keys
> + Up arrow: accelerate
> + Down arrow: brake/reverse
> + Left arrow: steer left
> + Right arrow: steer right
> + Ctrl: drift (brakes with a sharper turning radius)

> ### WASD 
> **WARNING**
> Make sure CapsLock is off ^^
> + W: accelerate
> + S: brake/reverse
> + A: steer left
> + D: steer right
> + Space: drift (brakes with a sharper turning radius)

You can also use a combination of the above modes; do what works best for you (for example, using the `arrows` and `spacebar` to drift, `WASD` and `Ctrl`, or something creative like accelerating with `W` and steering with the `arrows`).

>### Remember!
>To play, you must have a valid account and be logged in.
>
>At the end of each race, you'll be asked whether or not to save your results. If you press `save`, your time will be saved in the leaderboard and other players will be able to challenge your ghost. If you press `delete`, you'll have to say goodbye to the match you just played.
>
> **Times longer than 5 minutes cannot be saved!**
